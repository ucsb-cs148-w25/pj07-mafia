My name is Andy Subramanian. I am 3rd year CS Major. My idea for this project is a session based game that revolves around the board game mafia or werewolf. The game is based on two sides one which are the villians/mafia/werewolf who are trying to kill all the villagers. The other side are the good villagers who are trying to survive. Depending on the progress and skill required for the game it would be cool to make it multiplayer.
