Start:
- updating the kanban board more regularly
- testing our game at least once a day from now
- merging our features more (daily or every other day) for deployment purposes

Stop:
- creating non-detailed PRs
- not setting deadlines for merging features to main/deadlines for tasks

Continue:
- testing code thoroughly before approving PRs
- good and constant communication
- working on features in parallel

Experiment: Updating our Kanban more often.
Goal: More issues on the Kanban board are updated.
Change: Check the Kanban board and its issues more often.
Measurement: There are less issues left in the Kanban board or everyone has an issue they are working on.
