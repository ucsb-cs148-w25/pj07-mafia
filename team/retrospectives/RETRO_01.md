Retrospective 01 Discussion:

Sharing schedules with each other to be more up to date with when people will respond.
Using a single document or place to store all our progress/project info.
- Could use Kanban or text.
- What would be in the doc?
- Could use Discord for more organization for information.
Organize our user stories into multiple EPICs (Characters, AI Chat)
Should discuss design before we begin to implement things.
We should try to figure out groups of people based on subtasks.
Discuss guidelines for PRs (deadline, how many people need to review it)

Start:
Start focusing on big picture details.
Start keeping a place to organize our discussions. (Discord server)
Start keeping a list of tasks to go over before each meeting/class time.
Start meeting weekly outside of class.

Stop:
Stop relying too much on ChatGPT.

Continue:
Continue meeting outside of class.


Retrospective 01 Follow-up 1/29:

We have created a comprehensive discord server, with several different types of channels to organize 
communication and the storage of ideas/information. This includes the storing of notes on design, features, 
the big idea, meeting planning and our schedules, our upcoming MVP, any educational forums or videos for
topics we need to learn, and the server also facilitates the discussion of any of these ideas or plans. 
This has helped us to more easily start doing all of the ideas in the "Start" section.

We organized our user stories into categories, though we decided that it would be helpful for everyone
to not specialize in any specific category and work on different ends of the project so that everyone
is well educated on the ins and outs.

In person and through discord, we have started to divide tasks into subgroups that can more easily meet
and work together due to aligned schedules. This allows us to have frequent meetings in our subgroups but
still have everyone meet at least 3 times a week for class/section so that the general ideas can be discussed.

We have good about consistently reminding each other to not rely on ChatGPT to code any portions of our project,
but to instead use it as a way to learn about topics and apply what we learned to our code.
