## Code Contributions

- Overhauled the UI/UX design, including updating the theme, color palette, and fonts to enhance visual appeal and accessibility
- Implemented the in-game timer and day/night cycle, ensuring dynamic UI updates based on the current phase of the game
- Integrated the Claude API into both the backend and frontend by acquiring an API key and developing functions to send messages, receive responses, and display AI-generated text in chat

- Developed a seamless transition from the lobby to the chatroom at the start of the game
