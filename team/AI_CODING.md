**AI Tool Utilized:** ChatGPT

**Outcomes Produced:**
- Added an "Instructions" button fixed at the bottom center of the page.
- Implemented a modal popup that displays instructions on how to play Mafia, including role descriptions for Doctor, Mafia, Investigator, and Normal Villager.

**Reflections:**
- **Usefulness:** The tool was very effective in quickly generating a functional and styled UI component, which sped up the prototyping process.
- **Ensuring Correctness & Fair Use:** I reviewed and tested the AI-generated code to ensure it met our project standards. Manual adjustments were made to ensure clarity, correctness, and compliance with fair use policies.
