**AI Tool Utilized:** ChatGPT

**Outcomes Produced:**
- Added an "Instructions" button fixed at the bottom center of the page.
- Implemented a modal popup that displays instructions on how to play Mafia, including role descriptions for Doctor, Mafia, Investigator, and Normal Villager.

**Reflections:**
- **Usefulness:** The tool was very effective in quickly generating a functional and styled UI component, which sped up the prototyping process.
- **Ensuring Correctness & Fair Use:** I reviewed and tested the AI-generated code to ensure it met our project standards. Manual adjustments were made to ensure clarity, correctness, and compliance with fair use policies.

**Outcomes Produced:**  
- Determined the best location for unit test files in the project structure.  
- Established a **`tests/`** folder at the root level, with separate **`backend/`** and **`frontend/`** subdirectories for organization. 

**Reflections:**  
- **Usefulness:** The tool provided guidance on best practices for structuring test files, ensuring consistency across backend and frontend tests. This saved time and reduced uncertainty about where files should be placed.  
- **Ensuring Correctness & Fair Use:** I consulted the AI instead of deciding on my own because it has been trained on a vast dataset, having encountered numerous codebases across different industries. This broad exposure allows it to provide insights into **how professional developers typically structure their tests**, ensuring that our setup aligns with industry best practices.
