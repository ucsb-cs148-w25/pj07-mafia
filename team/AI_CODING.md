**AI Tool Utilized:** ChatGPT

**Outcomes Produced:**
- Added an "Instructions" button fixed at the bottom center of the page.
- Implemented a modal popup that displays instructions on how to play Mafia, including role descriptions for Doctor, Mafia, Investigator, and Normal Villager.

**Reflections:**
- **Usefulness:** The tool was very effective in quickly generating a functional and styled UI component, which sped up the prototyping process.
- **Ensuring Correctness & Fair Use:** I reviewed and tested the AI-generated code to ensure it met our project standards. Manual adjustments were made to ensure clarity, correctness, and compliance with fair use policies.

**AI Tool Utilized:** ChatGPT  

**Outcomes Produced:**  
- Determined the best location for unit test files in the project structure.  
- Established a **`tests/`** folder at the root level, with separate **`backend/`** and **`frontend/`** subdirectories for organization. 

**Reflections:**  
- **Usefulness:** The tool provided guidance on best practices for structuring test files, ensuring consistency across backend and frontend tests. This saved time and reduced uncertainty about where files should be placed.  
- **Ensuring Correctness & Fair Use:** I consulted the AI instead of deciding on my own because it has been trained on a vast dataset, having encountered numerous codebases across different industries. This broad exposure allows it to provide insights into **how professional developers typically structure their tests**, ensuring that our setup aligns with industry best practices.  

Team Member Hung Khuu:
1. AI Tools Used: ChatGPT 4o
2. Outcomes: ChatGPT helped me provide an outline of the backend structure to properly implement day/night phase management in our game. It suggested things like storing the phase states in the model file, handling all sockets stuff on our server side and not having the timer be in the frontend because its good to have the timer be universal for all clients. It provided a good prototype for how voting should work and how we should layout our files such that we can code each thing on our own in a way that is organized and not too messy for others.
3. Reflections: It was good to quickly learn how to organize based off what it thinks would work best for everyone. It also provided alot of architecture clarity that I could relay to the rest of the group quickly in detailed explanations. However, it was still important that I verified the code snippets because the AI does not know my entire codebase and could make things up about it from variable names to libaries that I do not use. One way to ensure it provides good results is to explain my issue, send in all relevant code, and then ask it to explain to me clearly each step and its reasoning.
4. Going forward: Looking towards the future I think ChatGPT is good for coming up with things that we do not want to do like comments or architecture explanations or guidance but when it comes to the details its not as good and you have to provide it alot of guidance.

**AI Tool Utilized:** DeepSeek

**Outcomes Produced:**
Gave me a list of User Stories and subtasks to implement on the frontend.

**Reflections:**
- **Usefulness:** This was effective in breaking down User Stories into small, easier-to-implement tasks. It also suggested adding a lot of features that I hadn't thought about. There were some User Stories that it gave that were already implemented though. This could possibly have been because those features were not visible from the frontend code I had given the model. But, some features it suggested were clearly already implemented.
- **Ensuring Correctness & Fair Use:** The only way that I could check how "correct" the user stories were was by seeing if they had already been implemented. I'm not too sure how I could ensure fair use for this specific result as there's no concrete source to point to that produced these stories.
- **Going Forward:** I think DeepSeek will be very useful in coming up with ideas to implement into our app. It covered a lot of blindspots we hadn't thought of. But we definitely should not be relying on it as it does not have the whole scope of our project in mind.

**AI Tool Utilized:** ChatGPT

**Ouctomes Produced:** 
Produced sample documentation for select frontend files. 

**Reflections:**
- **Usefulness:** It was fairly effective in understanding the purpose of our code and defining major variables/functions. It also had the potential to provide detailed documentation if asked to.
- **Ensuring Correctness & Fair Use:** The only real way was to sanity check and make sure that everything aligned with our intent.
- **Going Forward:** I definitely think it's useful but I think sanity checking will have to be done for every line written because sometimes it makes assumptions that may make sense for the specific file but maybe not in the context of our entire codebase and that is knowledge that only we have.
