My name is Victor Prchlik, I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at UCSB, and I'm excited to work on this project in CS148! For our AI mafia project, it seems intuitive that we would use the OpenAI API, and use some version of chatgpt to act as the AI that tries to blend in with the players. It would probably be easiest to make this a web app, but it's possible to also make it a mobile app. With how AI is currently, it might be pretty easy for players to see what players are AI, but maybe it would be easier if there was some sort of function in the game where the some players would also want to act like the AI (maybe some players are on the same team as the AI, or maybe they can act as a sort of diversion for the AI, and they can take a hit instead of the AI, making the game more complex).
