My name is Hung Khuu I'm a 3rd year CS major
My idea for the project would closely follow the idea of a game like Town of Salem's take on Mafia where it would be online and essentially the players would all have different roles. The specifics would have to be more clear as it'd be a game design thing later on but essentially there would be a group of players and a group of AI chatbots. The goal of the AI chatbots would be to pretend to be actual humans and not get voted out. The goal of the players are to find the AI every round. To make it interesting maybe one person can be given the role of pretending to be AI and they win if they get voted out.
