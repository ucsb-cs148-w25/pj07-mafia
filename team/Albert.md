Albert Wang, 3rd-year CS major. My Mafia project aims to provide an engaging and interactive way to explore the behavior and limitations of LLMs in social and strategic contexts, such as games. While the primary goal of Mafia is social deduction and role-playing, this project adds a unique twist by introducing LLMs as hidden players. Human players interact with both AI and real players, and the additional challenge of identifying the LLM creates a fun and engaging way to explore the behavior of LLMs in social contexts.
