# User Feedback Needs

## Priority Areas for User Feedback

### 1. UI/UX Improvements
**Questions to ask users:**
- How does the new UI compare to the previous implementations?
- Does the theme match the name of our product, and is the name itself appealing and fitting?
- What suggestions do users have to make the interface more visually appealing and less cluttered?

### 2. Instructions and Onboarding
**Questions to ask users:**
- Are the instructions on how to play the game clear?
- Do the role explanations make sense and provide enough detail?
- Would tooltips or a quick tutorial improve understanding for new players?

### 3. Gameplay & AI Integration
**Questions to ask users:**
- Are the visual cues for player elimination clear?
- Would a dedicated “dead chat” channel improve engagement for eliminated players?
- How well does the AI chatbot replacement for eliminated players function in maintaining gameplay continuity?
