Decisions Based on Additional Feedback

### Product Features and Functionality
**Feedback Summary:**  
- The app successfully implements core mafia game functions: assigning roles, displaying them clearly, and enabling voting.
- Suggestions included adding an option to hide player roles to prevent accidental peeking and providing more flexible instruction access.

**Team Decisions:**  
- **Role Hiding Option:** We plan to add a toggleable sidebar that will enable the user to hide their roles.
- **Enhanced Instruction Accessibility:** We will explore adding an in-game Instructions sidebar component so that rules and role descriptions are available during gameplay.

### App and UI/UX Design
**Feedback Summary:**  
- Overall, the current UI is appreciated; however, several reviewers mentioned that the colour schemes and font choices could be improved for better legibility.

**Team Decisions:**  
- **UI Enhancements:** We will review the current colour palette with the aim of selecting options that are both modern and easy on the eyes, while preserving the game’s thematic appeal.
- **Round and Game State Information:** To improve game clarity, especially around player elimination, we will work on visual cues (pop-ups or animations) that clearly indicate when a player is eliminated.

### Repository Structure, Documentation, and Deployment
**Feedback Summary:**  
- The reviewing team praised the overall organization of our repository, README, and Kanban board.
- Minor issues were noted regarding the deployment flow.

**Team Decisions:**  
- **Documentation Updates:** We will update the README to clarify deployment steps, ensuring users know what to expect when they first access the app.
- **Deployment Flow Adjustments:** We plan to review the initial user flow so that new users are clearly given the choice between creating or joining a lobby rather than automatically being placed in a room.

### Final Closing Thoughts and Impactful Suggestions
**Feedback Summary:**  
- Reviewers highlighted the app’s strengths, such as its engaging theme and intuitive chat interface.
- Opportunities for improvement included implementing a “dead chat” channel, addressing win condition logic, and fixing role-related issues (such as non-functional doctor and detective roles).

**Team Decisions:**  
- **Role Functionality:** We plan to focus on critical bugs around role usage (e.g., doctor/detective roles not working).
- **Voting and Exit Logic:** We will reexamine the voting logic and game exit functionalities to ensure game integrity and smooth user experience.
