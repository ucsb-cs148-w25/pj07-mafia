# User Manual

## Purpose
DystopAi is a thrilling, strategic party game that gives the classic Mafia gameplay an intriguing twist where players are replaced by AI chatbots when they are "killed" by the Mafia. It challenges players to not only deceive, work with, and read others but also to navigate the complexities of interacting with AI. DystopAI is designed for anyone who enjoys social deduction games, loves a good challenge, and is curious about the growing role of artificial intelligence in our online spaces.

Whether you're a fan of Mafia or new to social deduction games, this game offers a unique experience where you'll have to discern who's human, who's an AI, and who's turning people into AI for their own gain--- and can you do all that while being censored by AI? The purpose of this game is to entertain while sparking thought about what separates humans from machines, and how AI is influencing our digital interactions.

This manual is intended for players of DystopAI. If you're ready to dive into the game, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to survive a DystopAI.

## How to Play
To start, users are able to either create a lobby, or join a lobby via the two buttons on the homepage that they arrive to. If you create a lobby, you are the host of the game and can send other players your lobby id for them to paste after clicking the join lobby button and join the game. 
- Only the host can start the game.
- You need at least 6 players to start the game. (This assigns the roles one Mafia, Doctor, Detective, and villager to all remaining players)
- There is a max of 10 players a game(With 10 players you get 2 Mafia instead of just one)

As with most Mafia-like games, players in DystopAi are secretly assigned different roles at the start of the game. The game provides you a chatbox to talk in and occasionally a voting button on the far right for you to click and decide which player to kill. The sessions are divided into multiple rounds of two phases: Day and Night. 

### Night Phase
- Certain players with special abilities (such as the Mafia) act in secret. The Mafia chooses a target to "kill," while other roles may have abilities that protect, investigate, or manipulate the game.
- The Night phase lasts 60 seconds unless all roles(Doctor, Investigator, Mafia) have finished voting in which case it ends.

### Day Phase
- All players discuss, accuse, and vote on who they believe is part of the Mafia. The goal is to deduce who the enemies are and eliminate them before they take control of the game.
- The Day phase is broken into two durations, the discussion and the vote.
- The discussion phase lasts 90 seconds where players are allowed to just talk and speculate while the vote session occurs after and gives players 30 seconds to decide on a vote. If everyone has voted it ends before the 30 seconds is up.

Unlike traditional Mafia games, DystopAI introduces a unique mechanic-- when a player is "killed," they are placed by an AI chatbot, which mimics their personality but may behave differently. As the game progreses, it beocmes increasing difficult to tell who is human and who has been turned into AI.

The game continues until one faction--- either the Humans(villagers and special roles) or the AI-aligned faction (Mafia)-- achieve its win condition.

## The Roles

- Villager: Their job is to vote out to try and find out who is also a human and to work together with them to vote out Mafia.
- Mafia: Their job is to manipulate the villagers during the day to not get voted out and replace everyone with AI at night by voting on who to replace.
- Doctor: At night they choose who to "protect" and if Mafia has the same person selected to be killed the chosen player lives for another day.
- Detective: At night they choose who to "investigate" and if they have selected a Mafia/Ai person it returns "You have found someone who is Mafia or Ai" and if they selected an innocent villager it returns "The person you chose is innocent."
