# User Manual

## Purpose
DystopAi is a thrilling, strategic party game that gives the classic Mafia gameplay an intriguing twist where players are replaced by AI chatbots when they are "killed" by the Mafia. It challenges players to not only deceive, work with, and read others but also to navigate the complexities of interacting with AI. DystopAI is designed for anyone who enjoys social deduction games, loves a good challenge, and is curious about the growing role of artificial intelligence in our online spaces.

Whether you're a fan of Mafia or new to social deduction games, this game offers a unique experience where you'll have to discern who's human, who's an AI, and who's turning people into AI for their own gain--- and can you do all that while being censored by AI? The purpose of this game is to entertain while sparking thought about what separates humans from machines, and how AI is influencing our digital interactions.

This manual is intended for players of DystopAI. If you're ready to dive into the game, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to survive a DystopAI.

## How to Play
As with most Mafia-like games, players in DystopAi are secretly assigned different roles at the start of the game. The game is divided into multiple rounds of two phases: Day and Night.

- Night Phase: Certain players with special abilities (such as the Mafia) act in secret. The Mafia chooses a target to "kill," while other roles may have abilities that protect, investigate, or manipulate the game.

- Day Phase: All players discuss, accuse, and vote on who they believe is part of the Mafia. The goal is to deduce who the enemies are and eliminate them before they take control of the game.

Unlike traditional Mafia games, DystopAI introduces a unique mechanic-- when a player is "killed," they are placed by an AI chatbot, which mimics their personality but may behave differently. As the game progreses, it beocmes increasing difficult to tell who is human and who has been turned into AI.

The game continues until one faction--- either the Humans(villagers and special roles) or the AI-aligned faction (Mafia)-- achieve its win condition.

## The Roles

- Villager: Their job is to vote out to try and find out who is also a human and to work together with them to vote out Mafia.
- Mafia: Their job is to manipulate the villagers during the day to not get voted out and replace everyone with AI at night by voting on who to replace.
- Doctor: At night they choose who to "protect" and if Mafia has the same person selected to be killed the chosen player lives for another day.
- Detective: At night they choose who to "investigate" and if they have selected a Mafia/Ai person it returns "You have found someone who is Mafia or Ai" and if they selected an innocent villager it returns "The person you chose is innocent."
