## Overview
### Introduction
DystopAI is a web-based strategy and deception game that reimagines the classic Mafia experience with an AI-driven twist. Players take on roles such as **villager, mafia, doctor, and detective**, each with unique objectives. The **mafia’s goal** is to eliminate all non-mafia players without being discovered, while the **villagers must identify and eliminate the mafia** before it's too late.

What sets DystopAI apart is its **AI integration** — when a player is eliminated, whether by mafia attack or a majority vote, they are replaced by an AI-controlled version of themselves. As the game progresses, the number of AI players increases, heightening the challenge for the remaining players. The villagers must expose the mafia **before they all become AI themselves.**
