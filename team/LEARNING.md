# Team Learning Plan

## Current Familiarity with Tech Stack

As a team, our current familiarity with the chosen tech stack is as follows:

### React
- **Most team members are familiar with React**, having used it in previous projects or coursework.
- **One team member has limited experience** with React and will need to strengthen their skills.

### Node.js
- The team has basic knowledge of Node.js but will need to expand proficiency for backend development.

### Socket.io
- **Socket.io is new to everyone** on the team. Learning its implementation for real-time communication will be a priority.

### Firebase
- **One team member has prior experience with Firebase**, while the rest are unfamiliar. Guidance will be provided by the experienced team member as we explore its integration for backend support.

### ChatGPT API
- **Some team members are experienced with AI integration**, which will help in working with the ChatGPT API effectively.

### Website Deployment & Multiplayer Settings
- The team is **unfamiliar with deploying websites from scratch and implementing multiplayer functionalities**. This will require additional research and experimentation throughout the project.

## Plan for Learning Necessary Skills

To ensure the success of the project, the team will follow this structured learning plan:

### 1. Research and Independent Study
- Each member will **conduct research on specific technologies** based on their assigned tasks. This includes tutorials, official documentation, and relevant online resources.
- Learning will be **integrated into the coding process**, focusing on solving specific challenges as they arise.

### 2. Team Knowledge Sharing
- **Collaborative learning sessions** will be scheduled weekly to share progress and address challenges.
- Team members with experience in certain areas (e.g., Firebase, AI integration) will **mentor others**.

### 3. Pair Programming and Code Reviews
- Regular pair programming sessions will allow members to **learn from each otherâ€™s coding practices**.
- Code reviews will provide opportunities to **identify learning gaps** and improve understanding.

### 4. Agile Iterative Development
- Adopt an **agile approach**, where new technologies are learned and integrated **incrementally** as features are developed.


This plan will evolve as we progress and identify additional learning needs. Together, we aim to develop the necessary skills to complete our project successfully.
