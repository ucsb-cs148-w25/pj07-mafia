Type of meeting: sprint planning

Team: Priyanka Ballani [X], Shivani Madhan [X], Victor Prchlik [X], Albert Wang [X], Hung Khuu [X], Tyler Tran [], Siddhant Subramanian[X]

Discussion:

Shivani wants to just start with getting a lobby and a sort of chatroom right now and figure out AI stuff later.

Victor wants to start by working on one lobby so when you click a button it gets us into the game.

Shivani says wes hould have some people work on chatting feature and some others working on the lobby.

Priyanka agrees saying we should have three groups of people, some working on chatting, some work on lobbies, some work on the database for multiplayer.

Andy is unsure if we need to implement the database yet because it might take up time, we don't know what to store yet.

Priyanka is confused how we're going to store the in-game data then.

What do we need to figure out?
- We need to figure out chatting
- How to figure out deploying
- Heroku, Firebase, Railway, NGROK
- Front-end lobbies

Shivani is going to make a new issue and start assigning

We are not doing databases

3 issues in progress by the end of today
What we hope to accomplish by friday
We need a main lobby where people can join lobbies
Lobby needs to be sessions and people need to be joining(multiplayer feature)
And we can have a chatroom within these lobbies
Deploy and multiplayer is very intertwined into lobbies though because you need that so people can play.

Shivani worked on the kanban board we can refer to for the teams on what features to accomplish.

Store Session IDs(Shivani, Priyanka, and Andy)
Deployment and Multiplayer(Hung, Tyler)
Chatroom(Victor, Albert)

We're going to discuss again after.
