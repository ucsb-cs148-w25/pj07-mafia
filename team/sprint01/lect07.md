Mentor: Anderson

Meeting Time: lect07

Type of meeting: sprint planning

Team: Priyanka Ballani [X], Shivani Madhan [], Victor Prchlik [], Albert Wang [X], Hung Khuu [], Tyler Tran [X], Siddhant Subramanian[]

Discussion:

Tyler will focus on frontend. Has been working on a theme for the game. Roadblock is conflicts with other classes.

Priyanka was finishing work on the day night cycle. Will start looking into why the issue is not working. Roadblocks are other work.

Albert is working on trying to make it so that the front end can see which players are in which tab. Can be solved with backend logic, but it would be messy. Roadblocks are midterm. Will work on completing voting tonight.
