Discussion:

General Discussion:
- want to implement a vote screen into the game page.
- for MVP it will be a popup or separate page.

Andy combined the two servers in the project into one. Added the username functionality in the game lobby. Stuck on message UI. Will work with Albert on fixing the chat UI.

Priyanka is stuck on finding issues to work on.

Shivani created the start button in the game lobby to begin the game/transition into the chatroom. No roadblocks right now, finding something to work on.

Albert has been thinking ways to implement some of the feature. Will work with Andy to fix the chat room UI. Can also work on the voting interface. Limited time might be a roadblock.

Hung worked on cleaning the variables/making the code more modular. Will work on documentation for each file. Organized the backend into server and models. No roadblocks.

Victor met with other group members to plan out the long term goals of the project. Stuck right now on looking for what issue to work on next. Will try to find time to work on the voting mechanism.

Tyler is planning on working on the roles feature on the backend. Roadblocks are time and knowledge of the tech stack.
