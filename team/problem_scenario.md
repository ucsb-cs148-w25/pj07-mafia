**Scenario:**

Ethan, Amira, and their friends gather for a game night, deciding to play a traditional Mafia game. The excitement builds during the first few rounds, but soon, the familiar gameplay cycle sets in: eliminated players are forced to sit idle until the next game begins, while the rest of the group continues playing. Amira, eliminated in the first round, spends the next 20 minutes scrolling on her phone, feeling disengaged. Meanwhile, Ethan complains that the game lacks variety and innovation after years of playing similar versions.

**The Problem:**
- Once eliminated, players feel excluded and disconnected from the ongoing game.
- Traditional mafia games can become stale and repetitive, with little innovation to surprise seasoned players.
- There’s a lack of integration between strategy, social interaction, and modern technology to enhance engagement and add depth to the gameplay.

**The Goal:**

The AI-integrated Mafia game addresses these challenges by introducing innovative mechanics:
1. Eliminated players transition into AI roles, ensuring they remain active participants in the game and adding a new layer of unpredictability.
2. AI mechanics heighten the stakes, creating a dynamic experience that blends human strategy with AI unpredictability.
3. The game reinvigorates the classic Mafia gameplay, appealing to both seasoned players and newcomers, providing an engaging and evolving experience for all participants.

This solution brings the social and strategic thrill of Mafia into the modern era, ensuring no player is left behind while introducing AI as a core element to elevate the game’s replay value.
