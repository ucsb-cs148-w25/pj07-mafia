# Basic Web App: Game Start to Game Over

This README provides clear instructions for installing the necessary software and deploying the basic web app built with React. The app contains a "Game Start" button that navigates to a "Game Over" page upon interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the app, ensure the following software is installed on your system:

### 1. **Node.js and npm**

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (recommended: LTS version).
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js.

**Installation:**

- Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  node -v   # Should print the Node.js version (e.g., v18.x.x)
  npm -v    # Should print the npm version (e.g., 9.x.x)
  ```

### 2. **Git**

- Required for cloning the repository.

**Installation:**

- Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  git --version  # Should print the Git version
  ```

## Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the app locally:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local system using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the repository containing the app.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd helloWorld/helloWorld_AW
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Start the React development server to preview the app:

```bash
npm start
```

- The app will open automatically in your default browser.
- Alternatively, visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
