# Basic Web App: Chat Room Game
By: Hung Khuu

This README is to provide clear instructions for how to install the necessary softwae as well as running the basic web app built with React on localhost. The app simply has a button to start the game which then leads you into a chat room similar to what we will have for AI Mafia where you can enter messages and see them pop up.

1. Node.js and NPM
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 18 or above preferably)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

2. Git
Also install Git so that you can clone the repository to your local computer.

How to deploy:
Start by going into terminal and proceeding to do the following steps
1. git clone <https://github.com/ucsb-cs148-w25/pj07-mafia.git>
2. git branch helloWorld_HK (branch into the branch you are reading this README from)
3. cd into helloWorld folder from PJ07-MAFIA.
4. npm install
5. npm run dev
6. This should give you a link like local: http://localhost:5173/ that you can enter into your searchbar and reach the website.
